TODO list of things to do
=========================

High-priority
-------------
 - [ ] Add multi-task video link once the camera-ready version is done (can't
     think of a good mini-video-on-hover since the outputs are not as visual
     as, e.g., SLAM)
 - [ ] Add PQ-SGD to website
 - [ ] Link to LP3 page from main page once the LP3 video is online

Misc
----
 * [ ] Shrink my headshot ~2x on mobile, since it's a bit too huge now.
 * [ ] Make Bibtex pop up, rather than insta-download (annoying)
 * [ ] Make publications clickable, and expand to show abstract and additional links
 * [ ] Add proper website/bookmark icon
 * [ ] Add CV (resume) download link.
 * [ ] Automatic link checking to prevent/minimize link rot (git hook)
 * [ ] Add URL to Pit30M BibTeX once arXiv/proceedings available
 * [ ] Make repo private
 * [ ] Add CoRL talk video

Low-priority
-----------
 * [ ] On small screens, on all pages except the main, completely hide my name & face, instead of flowing it on top of
       the main content, which could be annoying to readers.
 * [ ] Add paper reviews as txt files.
 * [ ] Collapse TL;DR into expandable box on mobile
 * [ ] Make site fully responsive even with no JavaScript
 * [ ] Add IROS talk video (does that even exist?)
 * [ ] PDF / Blog post about NMOP project.
     - insights may re-appear in our AMV-SLAM paper after all!
 * [ ] Auto-render publications from raw bib files.
 * [ ] Automatic link archival a la Gwern

Done
---
 - [X] Add multi-task paper to website
