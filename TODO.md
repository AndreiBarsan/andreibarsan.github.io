TODO list of things to do
=========================

Misc
----
 * [ ] Make publications clickable, and expand to show abstract and additional links
 * [ ] Autoplay publication gif on hover (e.g., for GILL), and click for full video in lightbox (where available)

 * [ ] Update font-awesome and use new book icon for google scholar.
 * [ ] Add ResearchGate and ORCID

Low-priority
-----------
 * [ ] Automatic link archival a la Gwern
 * [ ] Auto-render publications from raw bib files.
 * [ ] Remove old portraits

 * [ ] Make site fully responsive even with no JavaScript
 * [ ] Add IROS talk video (does that even exist?)
 * [ ] Add CoRL talk video

     - insights may re-appear in our AMV-SLAM paper after all!
