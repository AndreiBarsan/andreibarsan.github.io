title: About Me
---

I'm a PhD student in the [Machine Learning
Group](http://learning.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto,
focusing on computer vision and deep learning for
autonomous robotics.  I started in September 2017, under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun">Professor Raquel Urtasun</a>.

In addition to this, I am also a full-time researcher at [Uber Advanced Technologies Group
(ATG)](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/) Toronto, also led by Professor Urtasun,
working on applying my research to the challenges associated with autonomous
driving in the real world.

In addition to machine learning and computer vision, my research interests
include robotics and long-term autonomy. I am also interested in machine
learning security, and I believe that more research is needed in this area
(together with its complementary subfield, interpretability), given the growing
influence of various machine learning-powered technologies on our daily lives.

# Education

 * PhD Student at the <a href="http://learning.cs.toronto.edu" target="_blank">University
   of Toronto (Sep 2017--present)</a>
 * MSc. in Computer Science with Distinction from 
   <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch" target="_blank">ETH Zürich</a> (Sep 2015--Aug 2017)
 * BSc. in Applied Computer Science from <a href="http://mateinfo.unitbv.ro"
   target="_blank">Transilvania University</a>, Brașov,
   Romania (Sep 2011--Jul 2014)


# Other Projects

 * MetalNet, a small toolkit for scraping and processing metal lyrics, followed
   by training a language model to generate its own metal. (Source code and blog
   post coming soon™!)
 * [Yeti](https://github.com/andreibarsan/Yeti), an OpenGL 3D game engine with
 forward and deferred rendering support, real time shadow mapping and more.
 <!-- * [µShell](https://github.com/andreibarsan/uShell), an experimental, simple, -->
 <!-- lightweight, free POSIX shell implementation written in C++ -->
 * A bunch of old games I developed for fun can be found on my old
   [Ludum Dare page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andreibarsan/). It may be
   tricky to build and run them, though, given the age of the code.


# Bio

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at [ETH
Zurich](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/).
For my Master's Thesis, I developed
<a href="https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/DynSLAM">DynSLAM</a>, a dense mapping
system capable of simultaneously reconstructing dynamic and potentially dynamic
objects encountered in an environment, in addition to the background map, using
just stereo input. More details can be found on the <a href="/dynslam">
DynSLAM project page</a>.

Previously, while doing my undergraduate studies at
<a href="https://mateinfo.unitbv.ro/">Transilvania University</a>, in Brașov, 
Romania, I interned at Microsoft (2013, Redmond, WA), Google (2014, New
York, NY) and Twitter (2015, San Francisco, CA), working on projects related to
privacy, data protection, and data pipeline engineering.

I am originally from Brașov, Romania, a lovely little town which I encourage
everybody to visit, together with the rest of Southeast Europe.
