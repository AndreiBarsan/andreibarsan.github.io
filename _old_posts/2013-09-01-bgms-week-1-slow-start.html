<p>Well, here's my first update, with still not much to show. However, I've
  managed to add some rudimentary libgdx particle system support, as well as
  adding dynamically spawned enemies. I've also done some internal refactoring
  to speed up future development.</p>

<p>BGMS stands for Beasts Grant me Strength, by the way.</p>

<p>An actual demo is hopefully on the way.</p>
