<p>- prerequisites (Java)</p>
<p>- lack of up-to-date, proper, servlet tutorials (context). The goal of this tutorial is to educate the reader about the standard practices every web developer (not just ones using Java) should know. The final result will be a fully-functional, secure, usable imageboard. I'm not interesting in merely conveying a series of theoretical ideas - the real goal is getting your hands dirty and make the final site production quality.</p>
<p>- tool setup</p>
<p>- up-to-date comparison of popular (-ish) Servlet containers - Tomcat, Jetty, Glassfish</p>
<p>=&gt; pick Tomcat</p>
<p>- setting up our system, our database (well, no users, only boards and posts -&gt; maybe NoSQL?)</p>
<p>- XSS prevention, ReCapcha integration, flood detection, ip blocking</p>
