My main laptop is a 16" 2010 Sony Vaio.  Despite having been retrofitted with
a nifty Samsung SSD, it was still quite sluggish and a tad outdated.
Nevertheless, it had aged rather well, and I'm quite disappointed that [Sony no
longer make laptops]().

I was originally torn between purchasing a 15" MacBook Pro (highest-end
model--the one with the dedicated Ati graphics card) and this ASUS.  I was
actually leaning towards the Mac (about 60% confidence) but I ended up grabbing
the ASUS since the price/specs ratio was much, much better.

Spoiler: now I have a MacBook anyway.

So what are the first you notice about this laptop?  Let's take a look...

The good
========

* Great price/specs ratio ($1.8k for arguably better specs than a $2.8k MBP)
* Superior graphics card.  The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M is a powerful graphics
card, capable of running even the newest games (2015) at medium settings, at
the very least.
* Lightweight.  The laptop weighs slightly less than an equivalent 15" MacBook
Pro.
* Windows supports much more games than any other OS, if you're into that.
* Free accessories.  When I ordered the laptop for $1.8k, I was only expecting
the machine and nothing else.  When it arrived, however, the laptop was just
the centerpiece of a much bigger pack of goodies.  The package included:
  * ASUS gaming headphones with detachable microphone.  They're very sturdy and
  would deserve their own review.  The sound quality is very good (disclaimer:
  I'm not an audiophile) and their cable is a reasonably long no tangle,
  cord.
  * ASUS gaming mouse.  Wired, with two additional function buttons on the side
  (back and forward).  Has a resolution adjustment button which is pretty cool,
  but not extremely useful.
  * Adapters, adapters, adapters.  I got a free usb-to-ethernet and
  an HDMI-to-VGA adapter with the laptop.  Which makes a lot of sense,
  considering that the laptop doesn't have either of those ports, but they are
  still rather common.  When purchasing a MacBook, adapters like this tend to
  cost around $20 each, so this is a really nice perk.

The bad
=======

* Some instability.  I so far got two bluescreens in three days--one while
checking out [speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy) with an OS installing on
a VM in the background, and the second one after waking up my laptop from
hibernation, also with a VM running in the background.  I'm not sure whether
the laptop or faulty VMWare drivers are to blame in this case.  Possibly
a little bit of both.
* Construction could be a bit sturdier.  MacBooks do feel a bit more solid.
For instance, the screen hinge on the ASUS laptop feels a bit loose.
* Mouse software takes a while to start up, so about a minute after booting
with a mouse plugged in, the mouse will be disconnected for a few seconds.
* When rebooting, before logging in for the first time, the lights on the
keyboard don't work.  This is quite a pain when trying to log into the PC in
a dark room.  Again, I've never encountered such an issue on a Mac.
* The power adapter has a very big, clunky transformer.  I'm talking the width
and height of an iPhone 6 Plus, with maybe three times the depth.
* The touchpad supports gestures but doesn't feel nearly as responsive as the
one on a MacBook, even with all the up-to-date drivers installed.

The ugly
========

* Having to mess around with virtual machines in order to access a UNIX
environment certainly isn't ideal, but with a quad core i7 and 16Gb of RAM it's
actually not that bad.
* Windows on UHD displays is not a good idea.  I've decided to keep everything
at 1080p for now, since most apps look awful with scaling enabled.
Interestingly enough, I've never seen this problem on OSX, even with obscure
utility programs I've downloaded off questionable websites.  On a Mac, even the
crappy apps look very polished and fit in with the rest of the system quite
nicely.

Additional notes
================

Having messed around with Photoshop and Lightroom on a 13" MacBook Pro, I can
say that they don't move faster than on windows. (I know that is a widely
circulated myth.)
