I was originally torn between purchasing a 15" MacBook Pro (highest-end
model--the one with the dedicated Ati graphics card) and this ASUS.  I was
actually leaning towards the Mac (about 60% confidence) but I ended up grabbing
the ASUS since the price/specs ratio was much, much better.

The good
========

* Great price/specs ratio ($1.8k for arguably better specs than a $2.8k MBP)
* Superior graphics card.  The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M is a powerful graphics
card, capable of running even the newest games (2015) at medium settings, at
the very least.
* Lightweight.  The laptop weighs slightly less than an equivalent 15" MacBook
Pro.

The bad
=======

The ugly
========

Having to mess around with virtual machines in order to access a UNIX
environment certainly isn't ideal, but with a quad core i7 and 16Gb of RAM it's
actually not that bad.
