# Overview

Most academic papers can benefit from a short associated video, either
summarizing the main ideas or showcasing some qualitative results. Many machine
learning and computer vision conferences recommend attaching a short video to
a paper submission in order to complement it, showcase additional results, etc.
Furthermore, many conferences, currently operating in a remote manner, ask
presenters to provide videos in advance to act as a replacement for the
in-person live talks. While this is unfortunate in a way, as nothing can really
replace in-person sessions and networking, it does open the door to putting
a little bit more thought and creativity in one's talks: preparing more
interesting visualizations, doing more professional editing, etc.

However, there are many decisions which must be made in order to determine what
makes for a good video.

While I am still far from an expert in video editing myself, over times I have
gathered a number of tips and tricks. 

# Tools 

[Screencast-o-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com) seems like a nice tool for
Mac screen recording, closed captioning, basic editing, etc., and it’s
C$25/year, so seems worth it. Otherwise, relying on Zoom for closed caption
generation is very unreliable--sometimes it can take over 24h to get the
caption file.

# Hardware

A good microphone and camera combo can make a huge difference in the quality of
academic videos. While not all videos need a face cam, audio narration is
always a nice thing to have.

**Audio:** I am currently in the process of learning more about audio
equipment. Stay tuned! :)

**Video:** I have recently purchased a [Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html) webcam, after getting tired of my old 720p Macbook camera. While quite pricey, at C$250+tax in February 2021, it is still much cheaper and easier to set up than a dedicated DSLR, while still offering 60FPS 1080p recording, 30FPS 4k, as well as HDR. I've recorded a few videos with it so far, and the footage quality is very good.

<!--
That being said, it's still a little frustrating that we only get 30FPS 4k with
a standalone camera, whereas most decent phones do 60FPS+ 4k these days, but eh,
you can't have it all I guess.

# Examples of Great Academic Videos

Great paper videos we can use as inspiration.
 * Smooth Rotation Belief Representations (UofT, RSS ‘20):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEp6amPkkKw 
 * All of Jon T. Barron’s videos/talks, e.g., “A General and Adaptive Robust Loss
Function”
 * Abe Davis’s videos, like Crowdsampling the Plenoptic Function
 * Qualcomm makes very professional videos with a blog post with top highlights
for every conference. Example from NeurIPS 2020. (Thanks to Julieta for
pointing me to this page!)
 * For general examples on polished videos and attention to detail, the “Two
Minute Papers” YouTube channel is also a nice (albeit not too technical)
reference.


**Audio:** Some animations may benefit from subtle sound effects. We could also
look into very low-volume royalty-free music to add to the videos.
