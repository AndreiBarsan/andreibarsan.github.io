<p>Not having worked with Java on a large-scale project before, I had also
  never touched Maven. (In this case, by large-scale project, I mean a project
  with lots of dependencies and a more involved build process - I did write <a
    title="Try eeet!" href="http://github.com/andreibarsan/Yeti">a rather
    complex 3D renderer</a>, but it only had a handful of dependencies that
  never changed and it was a traditional "hit f11 to run" application).</p>

<p><a title="Making your stack more streamlined since 2001"
    href="https://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a> is a tool used for, well,
  a lot of things. It works with Java, C# and a bunch of other languages and
  automagically manages your dependencies and build process. It's essentially
  <a href="https://ant.apache.org">Ant's</a> bigger brother.</p>

<p>When looking to add an existing library as a dependency to a project, it's
  very often to see it offered as a <b>maven artifact</b>. It would look
  something like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.ning&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;async-http-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.7.22&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

<p>This can be a tad frustrating if you're in a hurry and you just want to
  download a jar to add to your build path. You just want to keep working and
  not have to deal with Maven. But worry not, Eclipse and I are here to help!
  It's very easy to sort this out in only a few minutes!</p>

<h1>Step 1: Converting your project to a Maven project</h1>
<p>This is a one-click deal in Eclipse. It's not even limited to Java projects!
  I'm using the Kepler Scala IDE and it's working perfectly. <strong>Note: this
    does NOT change your main project type. If it's a Java project, it STAYS
    a Java project. If it's a Scala project, it STAYS a Scala
    project. </strong>All this does is add another feature to the project. The
  "Convert to..." phrasing in Eclipse is a bit confusing.</p>

<p><a href="attachments/step01.jpg"><img alt="Right click on menu -&gt;
    Configure -&gt; Convert to Maven project" src="/attachments/step01.jpg"
    /></a>
</p>

<p>
You will get a dialog asking you for some configuration settings, but you can
use the default ones for the time being. They can be edited at any time anyway.
Click <strong>Finished</strong>. A little "M" icon should have now popped up
next to your project icon. That's it! You can now start managing your
dependencies with Maven! Pretty cool, huh? Moreover, your old referenced
libraries (the traditional stuff on your build path) are still there! You can
keep them there, or add them as Maven dependencies so that everything is nice
and consistent. It's going to be very clear how to do that after you've read
this little tutorial. It might be a bit of extra work, but it will make things
much easier in the long run.</p>

<p>(Note that in obscure cases where you're using a custom run configuration to
  run Scala apps - e.g. when using Akka - special care needs to be taken and
  the Scala Library and Scala Compiler need to be manually added to the
  Bootstrap entries in the classpath, within the run configuration management
  window. You get weird errors otherwise. But again, this is just a corner-case
  I've stumbled upon while working with Maven and Scala.)</p>

<h1>Step 2: Adding your dependency</h1>
<p>Notice that converting your project to a Maven project has generated a file
  called <em>pom.xml</em>. This is the so-called <strong><a title="It's NOT
      porn, it's pom. Jeez."
      href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html"
      target="_blank">Project Object Model</a> </strong>and contains all the
  info required for Maven to build your project. We're just using Maven's
  dependency management system at this point, so we don't need to configure the
  build process. We're still using Eclipse's build system.</p>

<p>Double-click the pom file to bring up Eclipse's fancy Maven overview. Which
  we don't need. Go to the tabs below and select 'pom.xml' to view the raw
  file.</p>

<p><a
    href="/attachments/step02.jpg"><img
    alt="Adding your dependency."
    src="/attachments/step02.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Just paste as many "dependency" tags as you want inside the "dependencies"
  tag and Maven will automatically fetch them for you (Yes, automatically. You
  don't even need to click anything. It will happen as soon as pom.xml gets
  saved!) and add them to the Maven Dependencies. You will now be able to
  reference the dependency in your code and use it like any library that's on
  the build path.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you're now using Maven for dependency management! Do note
  that Maven can do much, much more than this! Just take a look over <a
    title="Each more productive than the last!"
    href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-features.html" target="_blank">the
    list of Maven's features</a>.</p>
