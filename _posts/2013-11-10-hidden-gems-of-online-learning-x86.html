<p>Every now and then, you stumble across amazing learning resources on the
  web. Some great, extensive tutorials which lie on websites that somehow look
  deserted. You take a look - it's not spam, the tutorials are there, for free,
  ready to enlighten you. The only ominous thing about them is the fact that it
  seems that nobody is using that site. There might be comment section
  inhabited by only a couple of lonely comments. The site itself might look
  like it's ancient, but a closer look reveals posts are all very rich, just
  sitting there, waiting for someone to learn what they have to teach.</p>

<p>I got this feeling when I stumbled upon <a
    href="http://opensecuritytraining.info/">http://opensecuritytraining.info/</a>.
  The site is extremely simple but filled with amazing content at the same
  time. I was amazed when I found the wealth of information on that website.
  Everything is free, licensed under Creative-Commons Share Alike license. And
  I don't mean quick 5 minute how-tos or 15 minute screencasts. These
  are <strong>multiple hour-long, in depth courses, with slides, code samples
    and additional resources.</strong> Grab the slides and click the video
  links. You find yourself at the beginning of a 10 hour-long playlist on, say,
  <a title="Give it a try! Money-back guarantee! (iz funny because iz free)"
    href="http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html"
    target="_blank">x86</a>. This is <em>just the introduction</em>. You can
  continue with the <a title="More than movs, pushes 'n' pops"
    href="http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntermediateX86.html"
    target="_blank">intermediate x86 course</a>, <a title="Raspberry Pi,
    anyone?" href="http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroARM.html"
    target="_blank">an introduction to ARM</a> or an <a
    href="http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits1.html"
    target="_blank">introduction to software exploits</a>. All of them - 6-10
  hours long.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">There are some
    other great, well-known sites such as Coursera, Udacity and Khan Academy
    which are also amazing resources. They are also quite popular, so I won't
    be talking about them in much detail here, since they don't need the extra
    advertisement. They are gems, that's for sure, just not hidden
    ones.</span></p> <p>I found myself addicted to Xeno's lectures, and now I'm
  already cruising through the intermediate x86 course, frantically taking
  notes, looking at slides and writing x86 assembly code.</p> <p>The only thing
  that I believed was a bit of a problem was the absence of homework
  assignments in the form of programming challenges. I did go through all of
  the examples, re-wrote them, altered them (e.g. managed to successfully
  overflow my buffers and hijack my own program, which was a lot of fun), but
  some more concrete assignments would have been nice.</p> <p>This was only
  a problem while going through the main body of the course (the introductory
  one), since at the very end, the students (myself included) were presented
  with Carnegie Mellon's <a title="Open to everyone. All that's needed is the
    will to learn." href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/labs.html"
    target="_blank">binary bomb</a>. And this more than compensated for
  everything else! I will probably be talking about the bomb (and its numerous
  variations) in another article, but what this "bomb" basically is, is an
  executable that's provided with no source (and only a handful of debug
  symbols) which expects some sort of text input. You give it the right input,
  and it's defused. Feed it the wrong one and it blows up. And the only way to
  figure out what input it wants, is to run it with a debugger attached and
  simply step trough the assembly code, tearing it apart and, essentially,
  reverse-engineering it. This has been, by far, the best programming challenge
  I've ever done when it comes to ASM. I've had one A-HA moment after the
  other, constantly digging through the instructions and figuring out what
  makes the bomb tick. It was very, very fun. From now on, this will be the
  number one thing I will recommend to absolutely anyone wishing to really
  learn x86.</p> <p><a title="Go, go, go, go!"
