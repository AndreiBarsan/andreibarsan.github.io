<p>One of the requirements for my Bachelor's Thesis, which was written in English, was for the table of contents to be available in both English and Romanian.</p>
<p>Since I was using LaTeX (XeLaTeX, to be more precise), I decided there had to be a way to do this in a clever fashion (i.e. without having to manually create the Romanian ToC from scratch).</p>
<p>And, as it turns out, there is a way to do this, using tocloft! The original question I found while googling the issue is located here: http://latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=5438&amp;p=84468#p84468</p>
<p>I've cleaned up the code a little and updated the label names accordingly (to make it easy for anyone to change them into any language).</p>
<p>\newcommand{\numecuprins}{Cuprins}<br />
\newlistof{cuprins}{tce}{\numecuprins}<br />
% definition of the commands used for the Romanian ToC<br />
\newcommand\capitol[1]{%<br />
\addcontentsline{tce}{chapter}{\protect\makebox[1.3em][l]{\thechapter}#1}}<br />
\newcommand\sectiune[1]{%<br />
\addcontentsline{tce}{section}{\protect\makebox[2.8em][l]{\thesection}#1}}<br />
\newcommand\subsectiune[1]{%<br />
\addcontentsline{tce}{subsection}{\protect\makebox[3em][l]{\thesubsection}#1}}</p>
<p>% rest of shitte</p>
<p>clearpage<br />
\listofcuprins</p>
