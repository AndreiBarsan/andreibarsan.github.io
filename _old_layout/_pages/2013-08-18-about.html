<p>I'm Andrei BÃ¢rsan. I'm a CS undergraduate focusing on <code>null</code>. I'm currently interning at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, helping develop a pretty awesome project that hasn't been launched yet. I also took part in the Google Summer of Code 2012, working on the <a title="It really has lots of potential, but lacks a large ecosystem of developers and tools, sadly..." href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Main_Page">Crystal Space 3D Game Engine</a>, <a title="My summer 2012 baby!" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2012/andreibarsan/10001">setting up the engine to accommodate tools more easily</a>. I've also made a few (small) games, mostly using <a title="libgdx really is pretty easy to use" href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a> - as <a title="Ludum Dare 27 approaching and blog woes" href="http://blog.siegedog.com/2013/08/ludum-dare-27-approaching-and-blog-woes/">Ludum Dare</a> entries:</p>

</ul>
<p>I've also written a pretty extensive 3D game engine in Java using JOGL, which can be found <a title="Come on, give it a try!" href="https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/Yeti">on my Github</a>. It features both forward and deferred rendering, real-time shadows (implemented with shadow mapping) as well as post-processing support (SSAO, for instance) and scene management.</p>
<p>I've also messed around with some networking stuff, and implemented a <a title="Albeit not the nicest implementation..." href="https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/tftp">TFTP client and server</a>.</p>
