# Other Projects

In addition to my research, I sometimes build video games for fun. A lot of
these projects are incomplete, unmaintained, or both. You can find a subset of
them on my [Ludum Dare page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andreibarsan/).


# Friends with Websites!

Like Facebook but, like, in raw HTML!

 * [Syd](https://cs-syd.eu) has a lot of cool stuff on his website, including
     a very active and insightful blog covering a wide range of topics ranging
     from Haskell and type safety, all the way to sleep science and
     self-experimentation.
 * [Taivo](https://pungas.ee) (whom I also met while at ETH ZÃ¼rich) has a very
     active data science and machine learning blog, and while it's almost
     exclusively written in Estonian, Google Translate typically does a very
     good job so I can follow his posts!
 * [Davi Frossard](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/) from the University
   of Toronto has a cool website and a series of interesting blog posts on
   machine learning.
