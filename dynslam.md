## Abstract

<!--
We present a stereo-based dense mapping algorithm for large scale dynamic
environments. In contrast to other existing algorithms, we simultaneously
reconstruct the static background, the moving objects and the potentially
moving but currently stationary objects separately, which is desirable for
high-level mobile robotics tasks such as path planning in crowded environments.

We use both instance-aware semantic segmentation and sparse scene flow to
classify objects as either background, moving or potentially moving, thereby
ensuring that the system is able to model objects transitioning from static to
dynamic, such as parked cars. Given camera poses estimated using visual
odometry, both the background and the (potentially) moving objects are
reconstructed separately by fusing the depth maps computed from the stereo
input. In addition to visual odometry, sparse scene flow is also used to
estimate the 3D motions of the detected moving objects, in order to reconstruct
them accurately.

A map pruning technique is further developed to improve
reconstruction accuracy and reduce memory consumption, leading to increased
scalability.

We evaluate our system thoroughly on the well-known KITTI Vision
Benchmark Suite. Our system is capable of near real-time operation on a PC at
approximately 2.5Hz, with the primary bottleneck being the instance-aware
semantic segmentation, which is a limitation we hope to address in future
work.

We present a stereo-based dense mapping algorithm for large-scale dynamic
urban environments. In contrast to other existing methods, we simultaneously
reconstruct the static background, the moving objects, and the potentially
moving but currently stationary objects separately, which is desirable for
high-level mobile robotic tasks such as path planning in crowded environments.

We use both instance-aware semantic segmentation and sparse scene flow to
classify objects as either background, moving, or potentially moving, thereby
ensuring that the system is able to model objects with the potential to
transition from static to dynamic, such as parked cars. Given camera poses
estimated from visual odometry, both the background and the (potentially)
moving objects are reconstructed separately by fusing the depth maps computed
from the stereo input. In addition to visual odometry, sparse scene flow is
also used to estimate the 3D motions of the detected moving objects, in order
to reconstruct them accurately.

A map pruning technique is further developed to
improve reconstruction accuracy and reduce memory consumption, leading to
increased scalability.

We evaluate our system thoroughly on the well-known
KITTI dataset. Our system is capable of running on a PC at approximately 2.5Hz,
with the primary bottleneck being the instance-aware semantic segmentation,
which is a limitation we hope to address in future work. The source code is

## Additional Results

This section presents additional qualitative and (detailed) quantitative
results for which there was no room in the paper. The evaluation metrics
(accuracy, completeness) are the same as described in the paper.

### Reconstruction Accuracy

The following figures present per-sequence reconstruction accuracy results for
the KITTI odometry dataset, as opposed to the aggregate results included in the
paper.

     since vehicles tend to have many transparent and reflective surfaces, to
     which DispNet is more robust than ELAS. The unusual results for sequence
     04 are due to its short length.

### Reduced Resolution Experiments

This section covers a series of experiments which investigated the impact of
reducing the spatial and temporal resolution of the input on the reconstruction
quality. 


#### Reduced Input Spatial Resolution

We analyze the impact of the input spatial resolution on the accuracy and run
time of DynSLAM. Most of these experiments are performed on KITTI odometry
sequence number 6, which consists of 1101 frames exhibiting a good balance of
buildings, vegetation, and traffic.
Our findings reveal that, as would be expected, the reconstruction accuracy
decreases with the input resolution. Similarly, the run time of some components,
such as ELAS, also decreases when operating on lower-resolution input.

At the same time, we found that even when using 25% of the input dimensions,
i.e., $$306 \times 92$$ input, the system can still produce reasonable reconstructions, 
albeit only when using ELAS depth maps. The performance of
DispNet drops significantly when using low-resolution input, leading to noisier
reconstructions.

<br/>

Table 1: Mean inference time for ELAS and MNC, the most time-consuming elements of our
pipeline, as a function of the input resolution.

|---------|
Resolution | ELAS | MNC |
|---------|
100% | 121ms (std=7ms) | 231ms (std=5ms) 
75%  | 71ms  (std=4ms) | 229ms (std=4ms)
50%  | 33ms  (std=3ms) | 236ms (std=84ms)
25%  | 8ms   (std=4ms) | 235ms (std=10ms)
|---------|


Table 1 shows the inference times of ELAS and the Multi-task Network
Cascades, which are by far the most expensive operations in our system, as
a function of the input resolution. Note that while the computation time of
ELAS does decrease with the resolution of its inputs, the time taken by the
instance-aware semantic segmentation does not.
We conjecture that the reason behind this is the fixed number of object 
proposals (300, as mentioned in the original paper) generated by the first
stage and refined by the second one. Despite lowering the input resolution, and
with it, the cost of computing the convolutional image features, the run time
of the pipeline ends up being bounded by the proposal generation, ranking,
and refinement, which are almost completely independent of the input size in
terms of their computational costs.
Note that because of their generic nature, the processing times of the depth
and instance-aware semantic segmentation components do not vary in significant 
ways across different KITTI sequences.

![Resulting accuracy, as a function of the input resolution](/assets/dynslam/plots/reduced-resolution-result.png)
Figure 6: Input and reconstruction errors as functions of the input resolution.
The evaluation was performed on sequence 6 from the KITTI odometry benchmark. 


Figure 6 shows the reconstruction accuracy of DynSLAM as a function of the 
input resolution.
As expected, the general trend is for the reconstruction error to increase as
the resolution of the input is decreased. Nevertheless, for ELAS-based
reconstruction, we notice a small increase in accuracy at 75%, as compared to
100% resolution. 
A possible explanation for this result is the fact that reducing
the depth map resolution acts as a soft regularizer, reducing the impact of
small bumps and other artifacts on the overall reconstruction quality. 75%
resolution could therefore be seen as a âsweet spotâ for good
reconstructions, by reducing high-frequency noise associated with
high-resolution depth maps, while at the same time having sufficient resolution
to produce a faithful re- construction.
Another interesting effect is the fact that as resolution decreases, the 
reconstruction (fused) error increases faster than the input error. This is due to
the accumulation of errors in the map: if the depth maps become too degraded,
artifacts begin to accumulate in the map, leading to errors over multiple sub-
sequent frames. That is, an isolated erroneous (but large) bump in a depth map
is registered as an input error only in the frame in which it is present.
However, once it gets fused into the map, it might take several frames until
subsequent measurements âsmooth it outâ.
In other words, the regularizing effect of fusing depth maps across multiple
frames can start to backfire when the quality of individual depth maps drops
below a certain threshold, leading to severe map corruption caused by the
cascading effects of artifacts from different input frames accumulating in the
map. As is clearly visible in Figure 5.23, this effect is much more pronounced
when using DispNet depth maps. This can be interpreted as a reflection of the
fact that the DispNet architecture was only trained using high-resolution data.
ELAS, not being reliant on training data, does not exhibit this problem,
leading to reasonable results even at 306 Ã 92 resolution, i.e., less than
QVGA.

In conclusion, we found that using ELAS to compute depth maps allows DynSLAM to
function with acceptable accuracy even on very low-resolution input. On the
other hand, while capable of producing qualitatively superior vehicle
reconstructions on full-resolution input, DispNet depth maps lead to very poor
performance on low-resolution (e.g., 25%) input.


<!-- TODO(andrei): Add more qualitative results, also interactive. Oh, you
could even add a nice slider, instead of just a gallery! -->


#### Reduced Input Temporal Resolution

Given that the run time of our pipeline is dominated by the instance-aware
semantic segmentation phase which, as seen in the previous subsection, takes
roughly 250ms irrespective of the spatial resolution of the input, we present
a series of preliminary experiments investigating the possibility of avoiding
to run the computationally expensive segmentation every frame.
In other words, we consider the option of running cheaper components such as
visual odometry on every input frame, but only computing dense depth maps, the
instance-aware semantic segmentation, and the static map fusion every k frames,
with the hope that it would allow the system to operate closer to real time,
without significant losses in terms of mapping accuracy and completeness.
Early experiments showed that the 3D object tracking performs rather poorly
even when it is run every two frames instead of every frame, but that the
static map fusion remains accurate even when performed every 3â5 frames.
Because of this behavior, we choose to focus on evaluating the quality of the
dense depth map, using the non-semantic (i.e., full-frame) method described in
the paper.
As such, we use the first 1000 frames of KITTI odometry sequence 09,
which contain almost no dynamic objects.

The results of this experiment are shown in Figures 7 and 8. As expected, on its
own, the accuracy of the reconstruction is not affected since the input depth
maps are themselves accurate. On the other hand, the reconstruction
completeness score starts to drop significantly once fusion is performed more
rarely than every 4--5 frames.
In conclusion, the high completeness and accuracy scores obtained even when
performing the static map fusion every two or three frames show that it is not
necessary to perform this operation at input frequency. In the future, this
insight could be used to improve the efficiency of similar systems,
prioritizing tasks such as object tracking and planning to run on every frame,
but performing auxiliary tasks such as mapping with a lower frequency.
