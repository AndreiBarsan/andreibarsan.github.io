Hello!

My name is Andrei Bârsan. I'm a Computer Science Master's student at ETH
Zürich, focusing on deep learning and computer vision, together with their
applications in robotics, specifically autonomous vehicles.

In Fall 2017 I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science at the University of
Toronto, working on self-driving cars under the supervision of [Professor
Raquel Urtasun](https://cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun).

In the summer of 2015, I interned on Twitter's Performance Ads team, working on
data pipelines written in Scala, running on Apache Storm and Hadoop.
I co-developed the pipeline tasked with communicating engagement information
with Twitter's advertising partners.

In the summer of 2014 I interned at Google NYC. I was part of the Data
Protection Team within Google, and I helped developed a system for performing
security-oriented static analysis of Bash scripts.

In the summer of 2013 I was an intern at Microsoft working in the Server and
Tools Business division. I performed the security and reliability analysis of
a web service which was part of the Microsoft Azure portal.

My side projects include:

 * MetalNet, a small toolkit for scraping and processing metal lyrics, followed
   by training a language model to generate its own metal. (Source code and blog
   post coming soon!)
 * [Yeti](https://github.com/andreibarsan/Yeti), an OpenGL 3D game engine with
 forward and deferred rendering support, real time shadow mapping and more
 * [µShell](https://github.com/andreibarsan/uShell), an experimental, simple,
 lightweight, free POSIX shell implementation written in C++
