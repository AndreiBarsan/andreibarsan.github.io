I'm a Master's student at ETH Zürich.

Between May and July 2015, I'll be in San Francisco, interning on Twitter's Ads
team.

In 2014 I interned at Google NYC. I was part of the Data Protection Team within
Google, and I helped developed a system for performing security-oriented static
analysis of Bash scripts.

In 2013 I was an intern at Microsoft working in the Server and Tools Business
division performing security and reliability analysis for a web service.
