My name is Andrei Bârsan, and I'm a Computer Science PhD Student at the
University of Toronto, focusing on deep learning for autonomous robotics.
I started in September 2017, under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun">Professor Raquel Urtasun</a>.

In parallel to this, I am also a full-time researcher at [Uber Advanced Technologies Group
(ATG)](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/) Toronto, working on applying my research
to the challenges associated with autonomous driving in the real world.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at ETH
Zurich, also focusing on deep learning and computer vision, together with their
applications in robotics, specifically autonomous vehicles.
For my Master's Thesis, I developed DynSLAM, a dense mapping system capable of
simultaneously reconstructing dynamic and potentially dynamic objects
encountered in an environment, in addition to the background map, using just
stereo input. More details can be found on the <a href="/dynslam">
DynSLAM project page</a>.


Previously, while doing my Undergraduate at Transilvania University, in Brașov,
Romania, I interned at Microsoft (2013, Redmond, WA), Google (2014, New York,
NY) and Twitter (2015, San Francisco, CA), working on projects related to
privacy, data protection, and data pipeline engineering.

<!-- In the summer of 2015, I interned on Twitter's Performance Ads team, working on -->
<!-- data pipelines written in Scala, running on Apache Storm and Hadoop. -->
<!-- I co-developed the pipeline tasked with communicating engagement information -->
<!-- with Twitter's advertising partners. -->

<!-- In the summer of 2014 I interned at Google NYC. I was part of the Data -->
<!-- Protection Team within Google, and I helped developed a system for performing -->
<!-- security-oriented static analysis of Bash scripts. -->

<!-- In the summer of 2013 I was an intern at Microsoft working in the Server and -->
<!-- Tools Business division. I performed the security and reliability analysis of -->
<!-- a web service which was part of the Microsoft Azure portal. -->

My side projects include:

 * MetalNet, a small toolkit for scraping and processing metal lyrics, followed
   by training a language model to generate its own metal. (Source code and blog
   post coming soon™!)
 * [Yeti](https://github.com/andreibarsan/Yeti), an OpenGL 3D game engine with
 forward and deferred rendering support, real time shadow mapping and more
 * [µShell](https://github.com/andreibarsan/uShell), an experimental, simple,
 lightweight, free POSIX shell implementation written in C++
